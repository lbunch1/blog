            <p>
                Let me start by pointing out that I am not a writer by 
                any stretch of the imagination. I am simply starting this
                blog as a subject to practice what I have learned in the
                world of web development. At the time of writing this
                article, the site will be a static site with only html 
                and css. It will live strictly on a local machine for the
                time being.
            </p>
            <h3>Where is this going?</h3>
            <p>
                My plans for this blog is for it to grow along with my
                knowledge as well as document my progress. Style and 
                functionality should change either slightly or significantly
                with each additional post. I hope to transform this to 
                a basic cms as soon as I learn how to access and manipulate
                a database with nodejs. I am currently making my way through
                <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>
                and by the end creating a simple cms should be no problem.
