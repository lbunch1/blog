                Join me as learn to code and make horrible and embarrising mistakes.

                <p>
                    Let me start by pointing out that I am not a writer by 
                    any stretch of the imagination. I am simply starting this
                    blog as a subject to practice what I have learned in the
                    world of web development. At the time of writing this
                    article, the site will be a static site with only html 
                    and css. It will live strictly on a local machine for the
                    time being.
                </p>
                <h3>Where is this going?</h3>
                <p>
                    My plans for this blog is for it to grow along with my
                    knowledge as well as document my progress. Style and 
                    functionality should change either slightly or significantly
                    with each additional post. I hope to transform this to 
                    a basic cms as soon as I learn how to access and manipulate
                    a database with nodejs. I am currently making my way through
                    <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>
                    and by the end creating a simple cms should be no problem.
                </p>
